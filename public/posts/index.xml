      <description>Kombucha, simply put, is a fermented tea. It has gained popularity amongst my generation and has a big following. In my experience, it, like beer, is an acquired taste. I happen to like it a lot, but I can understand how it&amp;rsquo;s not really other peoples&amp;rsquo; cup of tea! Others drink it for its so-called health properties, like the millions of probiotics it contains. I don&amp;rsquo;t drink it for the health benefits- I like to drink juice and carbonated things&amp;hellip;and this is a great combination of the two.</description>

I want to focus specifically on the technology that is integrated into cars, specifically the climate control interface found in cars.</description>
