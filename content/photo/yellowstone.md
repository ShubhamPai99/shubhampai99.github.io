## Yellowstone National Park

This was one of the largest national parks I've been to. There's so many attractions you can see here that you *must* spend a minimum of 3 days here to catch a glimpse of everything! Enjoy the highlights below!


Our first day we spent at Mammoth Springs, Lamar Valley, and the Northern Rim of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone

Our second day we visited the South Rim of the Grand Canyon and attended a ranger tour. I will be honest, the views from the north and south rims are very similar. We visited the Yellowstone Lake and got our first views of hot springs and fumaroles! Before sunset, we visited Norris Basin and did a nature walk with our neighbor from CT!

Our third day we did the Yellowstone staple- the geysers! We were lucky to visit the park this specific day (July 18, 2024). Grand Geyser and Castle Geyser were both expected to go off at **1pm**! We decided to sit and wait for grand geyser at 12:15pm and the geyser began going off *literally 4 minutes later*

Behold Grand Geyser...

We then decided to walk over to Castle Geyser and wait for it to go off and *it started going off as we walked to it*!

We then visited a variety of hot springs, geysers, and fumaroles for the rest of the day. One of my favorite pictures is Grand Prismatic Spring below...
