## Grand Teton National Park
This park was interesting. There's a lot of water activities to do here. It reminded me a lot of state parks in Connecticut. You almost always get a view of the mountains from anywhere in the park. From the Jenny Lake Visitor Center, you may be lucky to catch **many** planes on final approach at nearby Jackson Hole Airport.

If you ask me, some of the best views of the park are when you hike into the Tetons. It reminded me a lot of the Rockies! 10 minutes after the below picture was taken, we sought shelter under a big boulder. An unpredictable and HARD rain came down upon us. We were ill-prepared without raincoats or umbrellas (weather reports didn't predict any rain, but the mountains don't care about the predictions!) and braved under the boulder for about 30 minutes. Nonetheless, the temperature drop after the rainfall felt amazing.
