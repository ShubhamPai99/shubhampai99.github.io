My name is Shubham (Shuh-bum)! I am a Digital DevSecOps Engineer at The Cigna Group.

## Terraform :bridge_at_night:
In my day-to-day work I create, manage, and troubleshoot AWS infrastructure for Cigna's Digital organization. This involves using Terraform, creating and modifying Terraform modules, and deploying infrastructure across multiple AWS account environments. Our basic principle: we (DevOps) focus on the infrastructure so developers can focus on their apps.

## Python :snake:
My strongest imperative programming language is Python. I've been programming in Python for ~6 years and have worked on numerous projects in and outside of Cigna. I find it an easy to pick up language that helps me test things, interact with APIs, and automate *tons* of stuff.

## Bash :hammer:
I learned Bash since joining Cigna and, although I still have to constantly look up sed, grep, and regex documentation, it's lightweight and powerful. I find myself using Bash for just about every project I use.

## Pipelines :construction_worker:
I wouldn't work in DevOps if I've never built a pipeline, right? I've worked with Jenkins, CloudBees, and, more recently, GitLab CICD. I've fell in love with GitLab CICD and I have a feeling I'll be soon falling in love in GitHub Actions :wink:

## Docker :whale:
In my opinion one of the best ways to minimize complexity across environments. Being able to grab an image and run Docker has made testing easier and locally running projects more consistent.

## Other Things About Me :sunflower: :tropical_drink: :airplane: :sunrise_over_mountains:
In my free time I am an avid gardener, kombucha brewer, and aspiring private pilot. I also enjoy visiting U.S. National Parks and hope you enjoy my favorite pictures from each one (Yes, I photographed every picture on this site)!
