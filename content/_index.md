My name is Shubham (Shuh-bum)! I also go by `shubs`. I am a DevOps Engineer at IdenTrust.

## Terraform :bridge_at_night:
In my day-to-day work I support IdenTrust's Kubernetes clusters, manage services in AWS, and manage GitLab repos through....Terraform! Whether it's deploying an external helm chart, ensuring parity across AWS environments, or creating standardized repositories, Terraform does it all for me.

## Python :snake:
My strongest imperative programming language is Python. I've been programming in Python for ~6 years and have worked on numerous projects in and outside of my career. I find it an easy to pick up language that helps me test things, interact with APIs, and automate *tons* of stuff.

## Bash :hammer:
I learned Bash since joining Cigna and, although I still have to constantly look up sed, grep, and regex documentation, it's lightweight and powerful. I find myself using Bash for just about every project I use.

## Pipelines :construction_worker:
I wouldn't work in DevOps if I've never built a pipeline, right? I've worked with Jenkins, CloudBees, and, more recently, GitLab CICD. I've fell in love with GitLab CICD and have just started dipping my toes in the GitHub actions space!

## Docker :whale:
In my opinion one of the best ways to minimize complexity across environments. Being able to grab an image and run Docker has made testing easier and locally running projects more consistent.

## Other Things About Me :sunflower: :tropical_drink: :airplane: :sunrise_over_mountains:
In my free time I am an avid gardener, kombucha brewer, and aspiring private pilot. I also enjoy visiting U.S. National Parks and hope you enjoy my favorite pictures from each one (I photographed every picture on this site)!
