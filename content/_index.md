My name is Shubham (Shuh-bum)! I am a Digital DevSecOps Engineer at The Cigna Group as part of the TECDP rotational program.

In my free time I am an avid gardener. I enjoy propagating and taking care of my numerous plants. I also brew my own kombucha every week. I am also pursuing a private pilot's license. I enjoy visiting U.S. National Parks and hope you enjoy some of my favorite pictures from each one!
