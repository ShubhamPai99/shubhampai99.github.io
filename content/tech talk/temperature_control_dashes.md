Digital technology has impacted and continues to impact our lives in many ways. From the smartphone to doorbell cameras, technology has evolved the way we think, work, and socialize. However, technology *can* be a nuisance. It can be distracting, infringe on our privacy, or even impair us from being able to just work. I want to focus specifically on the technology that is integrated into cars, specifically the climate control interface found in cars. The integration of technology into climate control interfaces is relatively new. For me, the first car that had a digital display was a 2015 Honda Accord. And it was cool to have at the time. The ability to connect your phone to bluetooth, a fancy digital display, setting your cabin temperature to a *number*. However, as I've grown up and started using this technology *while driving*, it's come to my attention that the interface is awful. 

We first need to understand the purpose of the climate control system. The climate control system in the car controls, but is not limited to:
- Air direction (e.g. directing air to just your feet, or just your face, or both, or defrost)
- Air speed/fan speed
- Air temperature
- Inner air circulation
- Front and rear window defrost capability

Now behold, the perfect example of this system:
