Kombucha, simply put, is a fermented tea. It has gained popularity amongst my generation and has a big following. In my experience, it, like beer, is an acquired taste. I happen to like it a lot, but I can understand how it's not really other peoples' cup of tea! Others drink it for its so-called health properties, like the [millions of probiotics](https://www.perkii.com/blogs/news/kombucha-vs-probiotic-drinks-what-s-the-difference#:~:text=However%2C%20recent%20research%20into%20kombucha,the%20end%20of%20shelf%20life) it contains. I don't drink it for the health benefits- I like to drink juice and carbonated things...and this is a great combination of the two. Storebought kombucha retails for ~$2.50/bottle, whereas you can make the same amount for a less than a third of the price and an hour of your time a week.


## History

Fermentation is an interesting process. It's believed that humans evolved alongside fermentation. Naturally, fermentation preserves foods for longer periods of time. Therefore it's believed that consuming fermented foods was advantageous for human survival. Being able to consume fermented foods without them spoiling meant that we didn't have to starve in winters! Almost all human cultures have utilized fermentation in some capacity-
- India: [idli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idli) and [dosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dosa_(food)) are soaked, ground, and fermented lentils and rice
- Europe: [Sauerkraut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauerkraut) is fermented cabbage
- Korea: [Kimchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimchi) is also a fermented Napa cabbage
- Worldwide: 
  - Cheeses are fermented products! Sometimes they are naturally fermented or mixed with mold spores to start the fermentation process
  - Alcohol: Unsurprisingly, any alcohol is the product of fermentation. Grains, fruit, or vegetables are first fermented to make beers and wines up to ~18% ABV. To make hard liquors, beer and/or wine is then distilled to concentrate the alcohol content (and subsequently aged in some cases). 
  - Sourdough bread
  - Yogurt

And what makes fermentation interesting is that sometimes 1) you introduce the bacteria/yeast to start the fermentation process or 2) sometimes you don't! For example, cabbages, carrots, and radishes already contain the good bacteria to kickstart the fermentation process and is, hence, how kimchi and cabbage essentially ferment themselves! Yogurts, sourdoughs, and kombucha typically require you to use a previous "culture" of the product to get the process going. 

## The Kombucha Making Process

This recipe is derived from [brewbuch.com](https://brewbuch.com/how-to-make-kombucha/). I highly suggest reading their website! My recipe just differs by timing, but that guide is super comprehensive of the whole process!
Kombucha involves a 2 step process before you can start enjoying your own:
1. First Fermentation
- In this fermentation, you brew sugary tea and mix it with a kombucha SCOBY (**S**ymbiotic **C**ulture **O**f **B**acteria and **Y**east). This fermentation typically takes ~1-6 weeks depending on your environment.
2. Second Fermentation
- In this fermentation, you take your fermented tea from step 1 and mix it with fresh juice/aromatics and ferment in a **sealed** container to allow for carbonation. This fermentation takes ~3 days - 3 weeks depending on your environment.

## Materials you need (makes 1 gallon of kombucha)
- A 1-2 gallon jar
- 6-8 Sealable 16oz glass bottles **safe for carbonting**. Note that [Ikea glassware is generally not considered safe for carbonating](https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1j9e2z/has_anyone_tried_bottling_with_these_ikea_bottles/)
- 14 cups of water
- Tea (loose leaf or 8 tea bags)
- 1 cup sugar
- 2 cups of kombucha starter SCOBY
- 2 cups fresh fruit juice
- Aromatics of your choice (ginger, cinnamon, mint, hops, etc.)
- Cheese cloth and rubber bands (to keep bugs from laying eggs in your brew). **Paper towels are not a suitable replacement**

Optional:
- heat pad
- Material to protect glassware from sunlight (I use a towel)


## Directions
### The first fermentation
1. Bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Take the water off the heat and stir 1 cup of sugar until the sugar has completely dissolved. 
2. Add 8 tea bags to the hot water and sugar. Steep for 20 minutes.
3. Clean and sterilize your 2 gallon jar. Pour 10 cups of filtered water into the jar.
4. Pour the steeped tea into the 2 gallon jar. Allow the mixture to cool down to 80°F.
5. Mix 2 cups of the SCOBY to the jar. Cover the jar opening with cheese cloth and secure with rubber bands
6. Place the jar in a warm, dark area and allow the brew to ferment. 
  - Optional: place the jar on a heat pad. Be cautious of the peak surface temperature of your heat pad. I lay some fabric towels over my heat mat to dissipate the heat to the jar. Ideally, the jar shouldn't be exposed to more than 90°F+.
7. For me, I wait 7-8 days before I'm ready to move to the second fermentation. Not sure how long to wait? You'll develop the taste after a few batches, but take a straw and taste the tea. Does it taste fermented? Does it have that kombucha-y flavor? If not, let it go a little further until it's something you like. 


### The second fermentation - time for bottling!
1. Take the 1 gallon of tea from the first fermentation. Separate 2 cups of the liquid and set it aside. This will be your SCOBY for your next batch!
2. Clean and sanitize your sealable glassware. 
3. Pour ~1/4 cup of fresh fruit juice into each bottle. Add an aromatic to the juice
4. Pour your liquid from the first fermentation into each bottle. Ensure a gap of air at the top of the bottle!
5. Seal each bottle and allow them to ferment/carbonate.
  - Optional: place the bottles on a heat pad. Be cautious of the peak surface temperature of your heat pad. I lay some fabric towels over my heat mat to dissipate the heat to the jar. Ideally, the jar shouldn't be exposed to more than 90°F+.
6. **CHECK YOUR BOTTLES** over the course of a couple days. If they are violently carbonated, put them in the fridge. The chilling action relaxes the carbonation (and makes it more refreshing to drink!)
  - **WARNING** there is a risk your bottles could explode if they are over-carbonated. Closely monitor your first few batches to ensure 1) that they're carbonating and 2) they're carbonating to your desire.
7. For me, I wait 3 days before I move the bottles to the fridge. Chilling them in the fridge for 24 hours will significantly reduce the violent carbonation. **I highly suggest opening your first couple batches outside [so you don't ruin your ceiling](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/9d83b9/any_tips_on_removing_exploded_kombucha_from_a/)**
8. Start your new batch of first fermentation so you can repeat the process!


## My Experience / Tips
I run the first fermentation for 7-8 days. My second fermentation takes 3-4 days. Your SCOBY will overtime adapt to the environment and schedule you put it in. 

How do I know what 80°F is? Truthfully, wash your hand and stick it in your liquid. If it doesn't feel super warm, you're good. 

I've been suggested to use 1 fruit juice and 1 aromatic for the first fermentation. Common aromatics I've used are cinnamon, ginger, cloves, syrup.

Use fresh fruit juice! Carton orange juice and canned mango pulp are just not the same as the real thing! Straining your fresh fruit juice also cleans up your bottles considerably.

My favorite flavors:
- Orange and Ginger (my most common batch I make)
- Pineapple and Ginger
- Apple and Ginger 
- Blueberry and Cinnamon

"Failed flavors":
- I haven't had much success in kiwi. 
- I've experimented with Mango, but the taste hasn't really stayed through after the second fermentation. 
- Don't mix vanilla extract into the second fermentation. I have a feeling the alcohol in the extract killed the bacteria in the batch I tried.
- I'm not a big fan of grapes and didn't have much carbonation with the one and only batch I tried.
- [Mint Cheong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KixQsFkAWN4). The syrup was good, but I never cracked a fruit that mixed well with peppermint flavor.
- Cloves are an interesting aromatic to use! But limit your use to 1-2 cloves per 16oz. Otherwise, they give a bitter/vodka-y taste that's very unpleasant.

Flavors I have yet to try:
- Lemon and Jalapeno (for a spicy margarita vibe)
- I really do want to crack the mint/fruit combo!
