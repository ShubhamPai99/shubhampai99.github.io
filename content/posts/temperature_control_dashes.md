Digital technology has impacted and continues to impact our lives in many ways. From the smartphone to doorbell cameras, technology has evolved the way we think, work, and socialize. However, technology *can* be a nuisance. It can be distracting, infringe on our privacy, or even impair us from being able to just work. I want to focus specifically on the technology that is integrated into cars, specifically the climate control interface found in cars. For me, the first car that had a digital display was a 2015 Honda Accord. And it was cool to have at the time. The ability to connect your phone to bluetooth, a fancy digital display, setting your cabin temperature to a *number*. However, as I've grown up and started using this technology *while driving*, it's come to my attention that the interface is just...bad. 

The climate control system in the car controls, but is not limited to:
- Air direction (e.g. directing air to just your feet, or just your face, or both)
- Air speed/fan speed
- Air temperature
- Inner air circulation
- Front and rear window defrost capability

And now behold- a great example of this system (2006 Toyota Corolla):

What we see here is
- Few buttons/controls: This system is 3 knobs and 3 buttons, making it simple to remember what each control does without having to look down
- Physical knobs with touch feedback: The knobs are intuitive and control one aspect of the system. As well, they only rotate in the spectrum of the display. For example, the rightmost temperature knob cannot be rotated outside the blue or red arcs. 
- Mechnical linkages between controls and effective control: turning a knob physically alters the system behind the interface. Thus you can "feel" the knob turn a piece behind the interface.


Let's look at another example (2015 Honda Accord):

- Many buttons/controls: This system is 14 buttons! Try memorizing all and not having to look at it while you're going 70mph on the interstate!
- No touch feedback: Okay, I'll admit, if you have to change the temperature it's easy. Just hit the left most buttons. But how do you know what the current temperature is and what you're changing it to? How do you know which of the other 12 buttons you're hitting are making the right adjustment. Interestingly enough, Honda realized this problem by integrating an eye-level screen that tells you what you're changing (not pictured above, but trust me). Still, unless you're looking directly at the interface, you're probably just button-mashing.
- No mechanical linkage: You click a button and a computer takes your input and then makes the necessary change. If you've driven this car, you know there is a noticable lag between hitting the button and the actual change that occurs. 


And for a final example (2017 Honda CRV):

- Many buttons/controls: This system is comprised of 2 knobs and 10 buttons. A step in the right direction! 
- Knobs with no touch feedback: Essentially the same issue as the Accord, but this time they **removed the eye level screen** that tells you what you just changed. They integrated knobs to control temperature, but the caveat is that the knob spins endlessly so you still have to look *DOWN* to see what you changed the temperature to! A step in the wrong direction!
- No mechanical linkage: same issue as in the Accord

Don't get me started on this one, which violates every previous interface:

The issue with the latter 3 interfaces is that you're looking at the interface more than you are at the road because it's so unintuitive! Especially at high speeds, I'd prefer myself and others to be keeping our eyes on the road more than these interfaces.

### Solutions

1. One solution is to add notches to the interface, similar to how your keyboard has notches to guide you to the "F" and "J" keys. This would allow you to be able to "feel" your way around the multitude of buttons and make them possibly easier to memorize.

2. Voice control: Being able to tell your car what you want could reduce having to interact with the difficult interface. This solution is, however, complex to implement.

3. Go back to the old system! With the advent of CarPlay and Android Auto, consumers can still get their need for digital technology in cars. Carplay can be the fancy screen you play with, while climate control is physical buttons. With the physical controls, consumers can enjoy safety, simplicity, and intuition. If it ain't broke don't fix it!

4. Regulation: I personally think that the Tesla computer screen is super modern and cool, but it should be illegal for a car to have such a large distraction next to your fingertips. There's no physical buttons in the interface, which leads to more distracted driving. I would support a law to ban distractive technology integrated into systems that requires high levels of attention.


I hope my thoughts resonated and you relate to these challenges. I'd love to hear your thoughts on these systems and other potential solutions you may have as well!
